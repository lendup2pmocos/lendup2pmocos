 The federal student loan rehabilitation program requires you to make nine payments within 10 consecutive months. You’ll need to work with your loan servicer to determine your required payment, which will be based on your disposable income.

You’ll also need to provide proof of your income and possibly your expenses. The Federal Student Aid website says your payments could be as low as $5 per month under a rehabilitation plan.
