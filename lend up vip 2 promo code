Loan consolidation is another option for getting out of default. You may be able to use a federal direct consolidation loan to pay off your defaulted loan. You can then set up an IDR plan for your new consolidation loan if you need to.

You’ll need to make three consecutive monthly payments on your defaulted loan before you can consolidate it. Your loan servicer will base the amount of the payments on your current financial circumstances, so they may be less than you were required to pay in the past.

Consolidation will get you out of default sooner, but it won’t remove the default from your credit report. It also comes with possible collection fees and additional accrued interest.
