Deferment and forbearance are two ways to temporarily stop making payments or lower your payments on federal student loans. Some private lenders offer one or both, with different rules.

Borrowers with subsidized federal loans or federal Perkins loans donâ€™t have to pay the interest that accrues during deferment. Forbearance, on the other hand, doesn't stop interest from accruing on any type of federal student loan.3 Private lenders decide how to handle interest accrual under deferment or forbearance.
